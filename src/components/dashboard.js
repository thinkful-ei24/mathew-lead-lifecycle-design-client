                <h1>Hello! Welcome to the Lead Lifecycle Designer!</h1>
                <p>This webapp was built in order to track leads in such a way to automate the lead lifecycle reaching out process. Many service businesses struggle with contacting old leads consistently. A person generally needs to hear about or from a business 8-10 times before they decide to buy so it is extremely important to reach out to leads consistently.</p>
                <p>This webapp helps to alleviate that problem by automatically sending text messages and emails at appropriate times after the person has been added to the system. Note that this functionality is not part of the MVP and, as such, has not been completed.</p>
                <p>The <strong>Lead Dashboard</strong> link will bring you to this page.</p>
                <p>The <strong>Create New Lead</strong> link will bring you to the Create Lead page.</p>
                <button type='submit' onClick={() => this.props.dispatch(dashboardHelpModalOff())}>Thanks!</button>
