# Lead Lifecycle Designer
### by Matt Williamson

## Overview
This webapp is designed to track leads for a service-oriented business. When a lead is entered, the app will automatically add upcoming "events". These events will be automatic emails, automatic text messages, and reminders to call the lead. The emails will be eventually handled by Send Grid while the text messages will be eventually handled by Twillio. 

Right now, the MVP is to have a user be able to login, serve a basic list of leads in a responsive table, be able to create a new lead and save to the database, and to have the webpage be responsive. 

This app was completed in two weeks with about two weeks of learning React/Redux.
